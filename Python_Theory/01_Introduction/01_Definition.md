# What is Python?

## Definition
**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. High-Level Language
- Abstracts away low-level details (memory management, hardware interaction).
- Focuses on problem-solving rather than machine-level operations.

### 2. Interpreted
- Code is executed line-by-line by the Python interpreter.
- No separate compilation step required (unlike C/C++).
- Makes debugging easier but can be slower than compiled languages.

### 3. Dynamically Typed
- Variable types are determined at runtime.
- No need to declare types explicitly: `x = 5` (Python infers `int`).

### 4. Multi-Paradigm
Supports multiple programming styles:
- **Procedural**: Step-by-step instructions.
- **Object-Oriented**: Classes and objects.
- **Functional**: Functions as first-class citizens, lambda expressions.

### 5. Cross-Platform
- Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
- "Write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

## Python Philosophy (The Zen of Python)
Type `import this` in Python to see the full philosophy. Key principles:
- **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
- **Explicit is better than implicit.**
- **Simple is better than complex.**
- **Readability counts.**

## Version Note
- **Python 2.x**: Legacy (officially discontinued January 1, 2020).
- **Python 3.x**: Current standard. This course uses Python 3.
