Title: Insertion Sort
Topic: Algorithms Basics

Theory:
    Build the final sorted array one item at a time.
    Pick element, find its correct position in the sorted part, insert it.
    
    Good for: Small arrays, or Nearly sorted arrays.
    Complexity: O(n^2) worst case, O(n) best case (if already sorted).
