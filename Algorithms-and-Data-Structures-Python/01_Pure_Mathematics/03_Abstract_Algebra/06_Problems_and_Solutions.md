# Abstract Algebra: Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1: Necklace with Constraints

**Statement**: Count necklaces with 4 beads, colored Black or White, such that **no two Black beads are adjacent**.
**Approach**: Burnside's Lemma with restricted fixed point counting.
*   $N=4$, $G = C_4$ (Rotations: 0, 1, 2, 3).
*   **Rot 0**: All valid linear strings of length 4 without 'BB'. Use DP/Fibonacci.
    *   Matches: WWWW, WWWB, WWBW, WBWW, BWWW, WBWB, BWBW. (7 strings). Fixed = 7.
*   **Rot 1 (90)**: Cycle (1 2 3 4). Monochromatic. 'WWWW', 'BBBB'. 'BBBB' invalid. Fixed = 1 (WWWW).
*   **Rot 2 (180)**: Cycles (1 3)(2 4). Pattern XYXY. No BB implies X,Y cannot both be B.
    *   (W, W) -> WWWW (Valid)
    *   (W, B) -> WBWB (Valid)
    *   (B, W) -> BWBW (Valid)
    *   (B, B) -> BBBB (Invalid)
    *   Fixed = 3.
*   **Rot 3 (270)**: Same as Rot 1. Fixed = 1.

Sum: $(7 + 1 + 3 + 1) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3$.
Patterns: WWWW, One B (any pos), Two B opposite (BWBW).
(Note: WBWB is unique. WWBB is invalid. WBBW invalid. WWWB is One B rotated. So 3 is correct: No B, One B, Two Opposite B).

## Problem 2: Permutation Iteration

**Statement**: Given permutation $P$, find $Q$ such that $Q^2 = P$.
**Theory**:
*   If $P$ has a cycle of length $L$:
    *   If $L$ is odd, $Q$ maps to this cycle by "interleaving". (Cycle $1 \to 3 \to 5 \dots$).
    *   If $L$ is even, we need TWO cycles of length $L$ in $P$ to merge into one cycle of length $2L$ in $Q$.
*   Condition: Count of even length cycles of each size must be even.

## Problem 3: Giant Step

**Statement**: Find the size of the group generated by two integers $a, b$ modulo $n$ under multiplication.
**Group**: Subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$.
**Approach**:
*   This is not just simple LCM.
*   The group elements are $a^i b^j \pmod n$.
*   This forms a 2D lattice structure in the exponents modulo order(a) and order(b), interacting if they share structure.
*   Generally simply traverse BFS from 1, multiplying by $a$ and $b$ until no new elements found (for small $n$).
