# Abstract Algebra: Methods and Algorithms

## 1. Decomposing Permutations into Disjoint Cycles

**Goal**: Convert a permutation array `p` where `p[i]` is image of `i` into cycle notation $(a, b, c)(d, e)$.
**Method**:
1.  Mark all elements as unvisited.
2.  For each unvisited $i$, follow $i \to p[i] \to p[p[i]] \dots$ until back to $i$.
3.  This forms one cycle. Mark all in cycle as visited.
**Complexity**: $O(N)$.

## 2. Applying Burnside's Lemma

**Goal**: Count distinct colorings of an object under symmetries.
**Algorithm**:
1.  Identify the group $G$ of symmetries (Rotation, Reflection).
2.  For each $g \in G$:
    a. Decompose $g$ into $k$ disjoint cycles.
    b. If we have $C$ colors, the number of fixed points $|fix(g)| = C^k$ (Each cycle must be monochromatic).
3.  Sum results and divide by $|G|$.

## 3. Generating Symmetry Groups

*   **Cyclic Group $C_n$** (Rotations of regular $n$-gon): Generated by rotation $\sigma$. Elements $\{e, \sigma, \dots, \sigma^{n-1}\}$.
*   **Dihedral Group $D_n$** (Rotations + Reflections): Size $2n$.
    *   Rotations: $n$ elements.
    *   Reflections: $n$ elements.
        *   If $n$ odd: Axis through vertex and midpoint of opposite side.
        *   If $n$ even: Half through vertices, half through midpoints of sides.

## 4. Baby-step Giant-step for Discrete Log (Generalized)

Works for any finite cyclic group (not just modulo $p$).
Requires group operations $a \cdot b$ and inverse $a^{-1}$.

## 5. Schreier-Sims Algorithm (Computational Group Theory)

**Goal**: Determine the order of a permutation group generated by a set $S$.
**Concept**: Uses Stabilizer Chain $G = G_0 \ge G_1 \ge \dots \ge G_k = \{e\}$.
**Complexity**: Polynomial in $n$ (degree of permutation), unlike brute force $n!$.
*   (Too advanced to implement fully here, but good to know existence).
