# Complex Analysis: Advanced Notes and Research Directions

## 1. Riemann Zeta Function $\zeta(s)$

Defined as $\sum n^{-s}$ for Re($s$) > 1. Analytic continuation to $\mathbb{C}$.
*   **Riemann Hypothesis (Millennium Prize)**: All non-trivial zeros lie on Re($s$) = 1/2.
*   Deep connection to distribution of Prime Numbers.

## 2. Several Complex Variables

$\mathbb{C}^n$ is much weirder than $\mathbb{C}^1$.
*   **Hartogs' Extension Theorem**: Singularities cannot be isolated points (unlike $\mathbb{C}^1$ where $1/z$ has singularity at 0). Holes in domain are "filled in" by holomorphic functions.
*   **Domains of Holomorphy**: Only specific shapes allow functions that don't extend beyond them.

## 3. Modular Forms

Functions on the upper half plane satisfying symmetries under $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ group actions.
$$ f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right) = (cz+d)^k f(z) $$
*   Crucial in proof of **Fermat's Last Theorem**.
*   String Theory uses Modular Forms extensively.

## 4. Complex Dynamics

Study of iteration $f(f(...z...))$.
*   **Fatou Set**: Values behave normally.
*   **Julia Set**: Values behave chaotically.
*   Essential for Chaos Theory.
