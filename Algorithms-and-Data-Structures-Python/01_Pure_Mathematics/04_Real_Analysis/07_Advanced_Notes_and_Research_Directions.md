# Real Analysis: Advanced Notes and Research Directions

## 1. Metric Spaces and Topology

$\mathbb{R}$ is just one example of a Metric Space (Set with distance function).
*   **Topology**: Generalized notions of "open sets" and "continuity" without distance.
*   **Manifolds**: Spaces that look like $\mathbb{R}^n$ locally. (e.g., surface of a sphere).
*   **Manifold Learning**: ML technique assuming high-dim data lies on low-dim manifold.

## 2. Measure Theory

Generalizing "length" and "volume".
*   **Lebesgue Measure**: The standard way to assign size to sets.
*   **Probability Theory**: Formally defined as Measure Theory with total measure 1.
*   **Almost Everywhere (a.e.)**: Property holds everywhere except on a set of measure zero. (e.g., $ReLU$ is differentiable a.e.).

## 3. Functional Analysis

Vector spaces where "vectors" are functions.
*   **Hilbert Spaces**: Complete inner product spaces (infinite dimensions). Basis for Quantum Mechanics.
*   **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**: The math behind Kernel Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Processes.

## 4. Fourier Analysis (Harmonic Analysis)

Decomposing functions into frequencies.
*   **Wavelets**: Localized frequency analysis. Used in JPEG2000 and signal denoising.
*   **Sparse Fourier Transform**: Algorithms faster than FFT for sparse signals.

## 5. Non-Standard Analysis

Rigorous formulation of calculus using infinitesimals (hyperreal numbers).
*   Justifies logical intuition of $dx$ as an infinitely small number.
